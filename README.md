## About me
I'm a Computer Science student at University of Catania who writes and contributes to Free Software.

## Projects
My most important project so far is [Minicraft for GBA](https://github.com/vulcalien/minicraft-gba), a GBA demake of [Minicraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minicraft).
I contribute to the development of the [Terminator](https://github.com/gnome-terminator/terminator) terminal.
